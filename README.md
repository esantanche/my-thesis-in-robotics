# Simulator of laser sensor for industrial robots

This is my graduation thesis. I used C++ to simulate a laser sensor that improves accuracy in robotic assembly operations.

## What it is about

It's about robotics. Industrial robots are programmed to perform assembly operations.

The parts they put together are supposed to be presented to them in precise position and orientation. 

In many cases those parts are not where they are supposed to be.

Even slight displacements cause the robot to drop the object.

My laser sensor measures objects' displacements allowing the robot to correct the way it grasps the object and reduce the possibility of dropping it.

## Used technologies

* C++
* Image processing algorithms
* Image recognition algorithms 

## Produced images

The folder ProducedImages contains images produces by the C++ code you find in the repository.

You see there the simulation of a laser swiping an object.

There are as well the points that the image recognition algorithm found that are corners or edge that can be used to measure any displacement.
